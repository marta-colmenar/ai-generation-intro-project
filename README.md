## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment (VS Code, Google Colab)

### Required Libraries
Install the following Python packages:
```bash
pip install transformers torch torchvision matplotlib pillow requests numpy
```

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Start with Task 0** if you need a Python refresher
2. **Follow tasks in order** - each builds on previous concepts
3. **Watch the videos** provided in each task for better understanding
4. **Try the interactive demos** before diving into code
5. **Experiment freely** - modify parameters and prompts to see how outputs change

## Learning Approach

### Hands-On Learning
Each task combines:
- **Conceptual videos** to understand the theory
- **Interactive demos** to see AI in action
- **Practical coding** to implement solutions
- **Creative exploration** to discover possibilities

## Technical Notes

### Model Downloads
- First runs may download pre-trained models (can be 500MB+)
- Ensure stable internet connection for initial setup
- Models are cached locally after first download

### Performance Considerations
- **GPU recommended** but not required for most tasks
- **RAM requirements**: 4GB+ for comfortable experience
- **Processing time**: Image generation tasks may take longer

### Troubleshooting
- If models fail to load, check internet connection
- For memory issues, restart your Python kernel
- Some tasks provide alternative lightweight models

## Tips for Success

### Best Practices
1. **Read instructions carefully** before running code
2. **Experiment with parameters** to understand their effects
3. **Document your observations** and interesting discoveries
4. **Ask questions** and seek help when stuck
5. **Share your creations** with classmates for feedback

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't skip the conceptual videos - they provide crucial context
- Don't rush through tasks - take time to understand each concept
- Don't hesitate to modify code - experimentation is encouraged
- Don't ignore error messages - they often provide helpful guidance

### Making It Your Own
- **Personalize prompts** with your interests and hobbies
- **Explore different styles** in image generation
- **Test edge cases** to understand model limitations
- **Combine concepts** in creative ways
